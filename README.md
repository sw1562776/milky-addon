# Milky Mod (Meteor Addon For minecraft 1.21.4)

- AutoSnowman
  - Build a snowman.

This mod isn't meant to be serious or useful — it's just 🐮 and friends talking big. (🐮, on July 30, complained about how 2b2t.org has no decent open-source PVP mods.) Realistically, there’s a 99% chance this gets abandoned in three days. But in that glorious 1%, you might witness 🐮 grinding hard, sprinting full speed toward building an actual PVP module. If that sounds fun to you, stick around (🐮's discord dandelion_94876).
